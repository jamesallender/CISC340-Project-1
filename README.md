# CISC340-Project-1
Demonstrating functionality:
test1.txt - tests the assembler with a loop, lw using a label, comments, and jalr
test2.txt - tests the assembler with all instuction types. Uses the biggest and smallest possible immediate values
test3.txt - tests the assembler with both tabs and spaces as well as using an immediate value that is not on the first line
test4.txt - tests the assembler with extra white space on the front of an instruction
test5.txt - test case given from Dr. Myre. Tests loops, label, several instruction types

Demonstrating error checking:
test5.txt - tests the assembler to ensure a missing instruction param is caught
test6.txt - tests the assembler to ensure a missing instruction param is caught
test7.txt - tests a valid label that has no corresponding value
test8.txt - tests an invalid label that starts with a number
test9.txt - tests a label that is too long
test10.txt - tests an invalid label with an "@"
test11.txt - tests an invalid label that starts with "#"
test12.txt - tests for exmpty parameters on instructions
test13.txt - tests for invalid registers
